**Knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub**
<br>

**What is Git?**
<br>
**Git** is used to archive a project's source code and history of all the edits developers do to their projects.
<br>

**What is WebStorm?**
<br>
**WebStorm** is an environment where individuals can code in multiple coding languages such as JavaScript, HTML, style sheets, TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, and Node.js. 
<br>

**What is GitHub?**
<br>
**GitHub** is a platform used by software developers for collaborations and web based version control. Developers can make changes to their software from their public repositories.
<br><br><br>



**Directions on How to Use WebStorm**
<br>
1. Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as a local program
3. Set up [GitHub](https://git-scm.com/downloads) by creating a GitHub account
4. Connect **GitHub** with **WebStorm** by pressing (Ctrl+Alt+S) in **WebStorm** to get to system preferences. Select Version control Git. Enter the path to the git.exe
5. Go back to **GitHub**, click + sign in the upper right corner, and choose "Create a New Repository".
6. Make the **repository** public and add the readme file, then click create.
7. To **clone** the **repository**, go to **WebStorm**, select VCS, and choose **Git**. Select "**clone**" and enter **Github repository** URL. Lastly, choose a local path for clone (i.e. folder on desktop). 
8. Go back to **WebStorm**, select VCS, and import a repository into version control.
9. From Main page Select Checkout from version control :arrow_right: **Git** OR From within **Webstorm** Select VCS :arrow_right: Checkout from version control :arrow_right: **Git**. Enter **Github repository** name. Enter local path name. 
10. Choose File :arrow_right: HTML :arrow_right: HTML 5 or File :arrow_right: Stylesheet
11. The Add to **Git** dialog opens. Click Add. This adds to local file system.
12. **Commit** your changes.
13. Occasionally, use **Git** to **fetch** changes from the repository by using "VCS ➡️ **Git** ➡️ **Fetch**" and **merge** changes by using "VCS ➡️ **Git** ➡️ **Merge**" into your local branch.
14. If there are any **merge conflicts** when merging, go into WebStorm to find the conflicting files and editing them to resolve conflicts. After fixing files add changes to **Git** and **commit** again.
15. **Pull** your changes from **remote repository** by using "VCS ➡️ **Git** ➡️ **Pull**". 
16. **Push** your changes to **remote repository** by clicking “Ctrl :arrow_right: Shift :arrow_right: K” Or “VCS :arrow_right: **Git** :arrow_right: **Push**. The file is now in **GitHub**.
17. To set up **GitHub** pages, click Settings, and check the **repository** name.
18. Choose the **GitHub** page location by selecting "Master **branch**".
19. Check your **GitHub** pages by copying the **Github**.io URL into a browser. Post the URL into Moodle with your **Github** account URL.
